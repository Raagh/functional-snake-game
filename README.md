# SnakeGame

Snake Game done in multiple functional programming languages or in functional "style"

I used it as an example to practice a few languages and get the "feeling" of functional programming, while I read multiple books.

Languages:

- Haskell - <mark>Incomplete</mark>
- TypeScript - <mark>Incomplete</mark>
