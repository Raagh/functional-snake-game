# SnakeGame

Snake Game done in multiple functional programming languages or in functional "style"

I used it as an example to practice a few languages and get the "feeling" of functional programming, while I read multiple books.

Languages:

- Haskell - <mark>`On Hold` till I get better at Functional Programming</mark>
- JavaScript with ramda.js - <mark>Done</mark>
